PSALM 139:14. • How the subconscious controls all functions of the body \\nWhile you are awake or sound asleep upon your bed, the ceaseless , \\ntireless action of your subconscious mind controls all the vit al \\nfunctions of your body without the help of your con-scious mind. For \\nexample, while you are asleep your heart con-tinues to beat \\nrhythmically, your lungs do not rest, and the proc-ess of inhalation \\nand exhalation, whereby your blood absorbs fresh air, goes on just the  \\nsame as when you are awake. Your subconscious controls your \\ndigestive processes and glandular secretions, as well as a ll the other \\nmysterious operations of your body. The hair on your face continues \\nto grow whether you are asleep or awake. Scientists tell us that the  \\n 45  skin secretes much more perspiration during sleep than during t he \\nwaking hours. Your eyes, ears, and other senses are active during sleep. Fo r \\ninstance,   many of our great scientists have received answe rs to \\nperplexing problems while they were asleep. They saw the an-sw ers in \\na dream. Oftentimes your conscious mind interferes with the normal rhythm  \\nof the heart, lungs, and functioning of the stomach and intestines b y \\nworry, anxiety, fear, and depression. These pat-terns of thought \\ninterfere with the harmonious functioning of your subconscious mind. When mentally disturbed, the best procedure is to let go, rela x, and \\nstill the wheels of your thought processes. Speak to your subconscious mind, telling it to take over in pea ce, \\nharmony, and divine order. You will find that all the functions of your \\nbody will become normal again. Be sure to speak to your \\nsubconscious mind with authority and convic-tion, and it will confor m \\nto your command. Your subconscious seeks to preserve your life and restore you t o \\nhealth at all costs. It causes you to love your children, which a lso \\nillustrates an instinctive desire to preserve all life . Let us suppose you \\naccidentally ate some bad food. Your sub-conscious mind would \\ncause you to regurgitate it. If you in-advertently took some poison, your subconscious powers \\nwould proceed to neutralize it. If you completely entrusted your self to \\nits wonderworking  power, you would be entirely restored to health. • How to get the subconscious to work for you \\nThe first thing to realize is that your subconscious mind is al ways \\nworking. It is active night and day, whether you act upon it or not . Your subconscious is the builder of your body, but you cannot \\nconsciously perceive or hear that inner silent process. Your busi ness is \\nwith your conscious mind and not your subconscious mind. Just keep \\nyour conscious mind busy with the expectation of the best, and make  \\n 46  sure the thoughts you habitually think are based on whatsoever thi ngs \\nare lovely, true, just, and of good report. Begin now to take c are of \\nyour con-scious mind, knowing in your heart and soul that your \\nsubcon-scious mind is always expressing, reproducing, and \\nmanifesting according to your habitual thinking. Remember, just as water takes the shape of the pipe it f lows \\nthrough, the life principle in you flows through you according to the \\nnature of your thoughts. Claim that the healing presence in your \\nsubconscious is flowing through you as harmony, health, peace, joy, \\nand abundance. Think of it as a living intelligence, a lovely \\ncompanion on the way. Firmly believe it is continually flowing \\nthrough you vivifying, inspiring, and prospering you.

Your subconscious processes are always lifeward and con-st ructive. Your subconscious is the builder of your body and maintains all its  \\nvital functions. It is on the job 24 hours a day and never sleeps . It is \\nalways trying to help and preserve you from harm. Your subconscious mind is in touch with infinite life and boundless \\nwisdom, and its impulses and ideas are always life-ward. The gr eat \\naspirations, inspirations, and visions for a grander and nobler life, \\nspring from the subconscious. Your profoundest convictions are those  \\nyou cannot argue about rationally because they do not come from your \\nconscious mind; they come from your subconscious mind. Your \\nsubconscious speaks to you in intuitions, impulses, hunches, \\nintimations, urges, and ideas, and it is always telling you to ris e, \\ntranscend, grow, advance, adventure, and move forward to greater \\nheights. The urge to love, to save the lives of others comes from the \\ndepths of your subconscious. For example, during the great San \\nFrancisco earthquake and fire of April 18, 1906, invalids and cripples \\nwho had been confined to bed for long periods of time, rose up and \\nperformed some of the most amazing feats of bravery and enduranc e. The intense desire welled up within them to save others at all  costs, \\nand their subconscious responded accordingly. Great artists, musicians, poets, speakers, and writers tune in with \\ntheir subconscious powers and become animated and inspired. For \\nexample, Robert Louis Stevenson, before he went to sleep, us ed to \\ncharge his subconscious with the task of evolv-ing stories for  him \\nwhile he slept. He was accustomed to ask his subconscious to g ive  \\n 88  him a good, marketable thriller when his bank account was low. Stevenson said the intelligence of his deeper mind gave him the  story \\npiece by piece, like a serial. This shows how your subconsci ous will \\nspeak lofty and wise sayings through you, which your conscious mind \\nknows nothing about. Mark Twain confided to the world on many occasions that he never \\nworked in his life. All his humor and all his great writ-ings were due \\nto the fact that he tapped the inexhaustible reser-voir of h is \\nsubconscious mind. • How the body portrays the workings of the mind \\nThe interaction of your conscious and subconscious mind requires a \\nsimilar interaction between the corresponding system of nerve s. The \\ncerebrospinal system is the organ of the conscious mind, and th e \\nsympathetic systemis the organ of the subcon-scious mind. The \\ncerebrospinal system is the channel through which you receive  \\nconscious perception by means of your five physical senses and \\nexercise control over the movement of your body. This system ha s its \\nnerves in the brain, and it is the chan-nel of your volitional and \\nconscious mental action. The sympathetic system, sometimes referred to as the in-v oluntary \\nnervous system, has its center in a ganglionic mass at the ba ck of the \\nstomach known as the solar plexus, and is some-times spoken of as  \\nthe abdominal brain. It is the channel of that mental action whic h \\nunconsciously supports the vital func-tions of the body. The two systems may work separately or synchronously. Judge \\nThomas Troward says, “The vaguest nerve passes out of the cere bral \\nregion as a portion of the voluntary system, and through it we c ontrol \\nthe vocal organs; then it passes onward to the thorax sending out \\nbranches to the heart and lungs; finally, passing through the \\ndiaphragm, it loses the outer coating which distinguishes the ner ves of \\nthe voluntary system and becomes identified with those of the \\nsympathetic system, so forming a connecting link between the two  \\nand making the man physically a single entity. 89  “Similarly different areas of the brain indicate their con-nection \\nwith the objective and subjective activities of the mind respectively, \\nand speaking in a general way we may assign the frontal portion of the \\nbrain to the former and the posterior portion to the latter, wh ile the \\nintermediate portion partakes of the character of both.” \\nA rather simple way of looking at the mental and physical \\ninteraction is to realize that your conscious mind grasps an idea, which \\ninduces a corresponding vibration in your voluntary sys-tem of nerves. This in turn causes a similar current to be gen-erated i n your \\ninvoluntary system of nerves, thus handling the idea over to your \\nsubconscious mind, which is the creative me-dium. This is how your  \\nthoughts become things. Every thought entertained by your conscious mind and ac-cepted as \\ntrue is sent by your brain to your solar plexus, the brain of your  \\nsubconscious mind, to be made into your flesh, and to be brought forth \\ninto your world as a reality. • There is an intelligence which takes care of the body \\nWhen you study the cellular system and the structure of the organs,  \\nsuch as eyes, ears, heart, liver, bladder, etc., you learn they c onsist of \\ngroups of cells which form a group intelligence whereby they  function \\ntogether and are able to take orders and carry them out in deduct ive \\nfunction at the suggestion of the master mind (conscious mind). A careful study of the single-celled organism shows you what goes \\non in your complex body. Though the mono-cellular organism has no \\norgans, it still gives evidence of mind action and reaction per forming \\nthe basic functions of movement, ali-mentation, assimilation, and  \\nelimination. Many say there is an intelligence, which will take care of your body \\nif you let it alone. That is true, but the difficulty is that the conscious \\nmind always interferes with its five-sense evi-dence based on outer \\nappearances, leading to the sway of false beliefs, fears , and mere \\nopinion. When fear, false beliefs, and negative patterns ar e made to \\nregister in your subconscious mind through psychological, emotional   \\n 90  conditioning, there is no other course open to the subconscious mind \\nexcept to act on the blue-print specifications offered it. • The subconscious mind works continually for the common good \\nThe subjective self within you works continuously for the genera l \\ngood, reflecting an innate principle of harmony behind all things . Your subconscious mind has its own will, and it is a very real \\nsomething in itself. It acts night and day whether you act upon it or not. It is the b uilder \\nof your body, but you cannot see, hear, or feel it building, as all this is \\na silent process. Your subconscious has a life of its own whic h is \\nalways moving toward harmony, health, and peace. This is the divin e \\nnorm within it seeking expression through you at all times. • How man interferes with the innate principle of harmony \\nTo think correctly, scientifically, we must know the “Truth. ” To \\nknow the truth is to be in harmony with the infinite intelli-ge nce and \\npower  of your subconscious mind, which is always moving lifeward. Every thought or action, which is not harmonious, whether through \\nignorance or design, will result in discord and limitation of all kinds. Scientists inform us that you build a new body every eleven m onths; \\nso you are really only eleven months old from a physical standpoint.

They are merel y \\ntwo spheres of activity within one mind. Your conscious mind is the \\nreasoning mind. It is that phase of mind, which chooses. For example,  \\nyou choose your books, your home, and your partner in life. You \\nmake all your decisions with your con-scious mind. On the other \\nhand, without any conscious choice on your part, your heart is kept \\nfunctioning automatically, and the process of digestion, circulati on, \\nand breathing are carried on by your subconscious mind through \\nprocesses independent of your conscious control. Your subconscious mind accepts what is impressed upon it or what  \\nyou consciously believe. It does not reason things out like your \\nconscious mind, and it does not argue with you contro-versially. Your \\nsubconscious mind is like the soil, which accepts any kind of  seed, \\ngood or bad. Your thoughts are active and might be likened unto \\nseeds. Negative, destructive thoughts continue to work negative ly in \\nyour subconscious mind, and in due time will come forth into outer \\nexperience which corresponds with them. Remember, your subconscious mind does not engage in proving \\nwhether your thoughts are good or bad, true or false, but it responds  \\naccording to the nature of your thoughts or suggestions. For exampl e, \\nif you consciously assume something as true, even though it may be \\nfalse, your subconscious mind will accept it as true and proc eed to \\nbring about results, which must neces-sarily follow, because you \\nconsciously assumed it to be true. 26  • Experiments by psychologists \\nInnumerable experiments by psychologists and others on persons i n \\nthe hypnotic state have shown that the subconscious mind is inca pable \\nof making selections and comparisons, which are necessary for a  \\nreasoning process.

Having once accepted any suggestion, it responds according to t he \\nnature of the suggestion given.

His personality becomes changed \\nfor the time being. He believes himself to be whatever the operator \\ntells him he is.

Edison, Marconi, Kettering, Poincarè, Ein-stein, and many \\nothers have used the subconscious mind. It has given them the i nsight \\nand the “know-how” for all their great achievements in modern \\nscience and industry. Research has shown that the ability to b ring into  \\n 128  action the subconscious power has determined the success of al l the \\ngreat scientific and research workers. An instance of how a famous chemist, Friedrich von Stradonitz, \\nused his subconscious mind to solve his problem is as follows: H e had \\nbeen working laboriously for a long time trying to rearrange t he six \\ncarbon and the six hydrogen atoms of the benzine formula, and he was \\nconstantly perplexed and unable to solve the matter. Tired and  \\nexhausted, he turned the request over completely to his subconsci ous \\nmind. Shortly after-ward, as he was about to board a London bus, his \\nsubconscious presented his conscious mind with a sudden flash of a \\nsnake biting its own tail and turning around like a pin wheel. This \\nanswer, from his subconscious mind, gave him the longsought answer \\nof the circular rearrangement of the atoms that is known as th e \\nbenzine ring. • How a distinguished scientist brought forth his inventions \\nNikola Tesla was a brilliant electrical scientist who br ought forth \\nthe most amazing innovations. When an idea for a new invention \\ncame into his mind, he would build it up in his imagina-tion, know ing \\nthat his subconscious mind would reconstruct and reveal to his \\nconscious mind all the parts needed for its manufacture in concre te \\nform. Through quietly contemplating every possible improvement, he \\nspent no time in correcting defects, and was able to give the \\ntechnicians the perfect product of his mind. He said, “Invariably, my device works as I imagined it should. In \\ntwenty years there has not been a single exception.” \\n• How a famous naturalist solved his problem \\nProfessor Agassiz, a distinguished American naturalist, disc overed \\nthe indefatigable activities of his subconscious mind while he slept. His widow in her biography of her famous husband has reported the \\nfollowing. 129   “He had been for two weeks striving to decipher the some-what \\nobscure impression of a fossil fish on the stone slab in w hich it was \\npreserved. Weary and perplexed, he put his work aside at last , and \\ntried to dismiss it from his mind. Shortly after, he waked one night \\npersuaded that while asleep he had seen his fish with all the missing \\nfeatures perfectly restored. But when he tried to hold and ma ke fast \\nthe image it escaped him. Nevertheless, he went early to the Jardin des \\nPlantes, thinking that on looking anew at the impression he should s ee \\nsomething, which would put him on the track of his vision. In vain—\\nthe blurred record was as black as ever. The next night he saw the fish \\nagain, but with no more satisfactory result. When he awoke it \\ndisappeared from his memory as before. Hoping that the same \\nexperience might be repeated, on the third night he placed a pencil and \\npaper beside his bed before going to sleep. “Accordingly, toward morning the fish reappeared in his dream, \\nconfusedly at first, but at last with such distinctness t hat he had no \\nlonger any doubt as to its zoological characters. Still half dreaming, in \\nperfect darkness, he traced these charac-ters on the shee t of paper at \\nthe bedside. In the morning he was surprised to see in his noct urnal \\nsketch features, which he thought it impossible the fossil i tself should \\nreveal. He hastened to the Jardin des Plantes, and, with his draw ing as \\na guide, succeeded in chiseling away the surface of the stone under \\nwhich portions of the fish proved to be hidden. When wholly exposed it cor-responded with his dream and his \\ndrawing, and he succeeded in classifying it with ease.” \\n• An outstanding physician solved the problem of diabetes \\nSome years ago I received a clipping from a magazine descr ibing \\nthe origin of the discovery of insulin.

About forty years ago or more, Dr. Frederick Banting, a brillia nt \\nCanadian physician and surgeon, was concentrating his attention on \\nthe ravages of diabetes.

Dr. Banting spent  \\n 130  considerable time experimenting and study-ing the international  \\nliterature on the subject. One night he was exhausted and fell asleep. While asleep, his subconscious mind instructed him to extr act the \\nresidue from the degenerated pancreatic duct of dogs. This was the \\norigin of insulin which has helped millions of people.

He tol d me \\nabout Dr. James Esdaille, a Scotch surgeon, who worked in Bengal before \\nether or other modern methods of anesthesia were discovered. Between 1843 and 1846, Dr. Es-daille performed about four hundred \\nmajor operations of all kinds, such as amputations, remova l of tumors \\nand cancerous growths, as well as operations on the eye, ear,  and \\nthroat. All operations were conducted under mental anesthesia on ly. This Indian doctor at Rishikesh informed me that the postoper ative \\nmortality rate of patients operated on by Dr. Esdaille wa s ex-tremely \\nlow, probably two or three percent. Patients felt no pain, and  there \\nwere no deaths during the operations. Dr. Esdaille suggested to the subconscious minds of all his pati ents, \\nwho were in a hypnotic state, that no infection or septic cond ition \\nwould develop. You must remember that this was be-fore Louis Pasteur, Josep h \\nLister, and others who pointed out the bacterial origin of diseas e and \\ncauses of infection due to unsterilized instruments and virulent  \\norganisms. This Indian surgeon said that the reason for the low mor-tali ty rate \\nand the general absence of infection, which was re-duced to a \\nminimum, was undoubtedly due to the suggestions of Dr. Esdaille to \\nthe subconscious minds of his patients. They responded according t o \\nthe nature of his suggestion.

Doesn’t it cause you to be seiz ed \\nwith a sort of mystic awe when you stop and think of the \\ntranscendental powers of your subconscious mind?

What you write on the inside, you will experience on the outside. You have two sides to your life, objective and subjective, visi ble and \\ninvisible, thought and its manifestation. Your brain receives your thought, which is the organ of your \\nconscious reasoning mind. When your conscious or ob-jective mind \\naccepts the thought completely, it is sent to the solar plexus , called the \\nbrain of your mind, where it becomes flesh and is made manifest i n \\nyour experience. As previously outlined, your subconscious cannot argue. It acts only \\nfrom what you write on it. It accepts your verdict or the conclusions of \\nyour conscious mind as final. This is why you are always writi ng on \\nthe book of life, because your thoughts become your experiences. The \\nAmerican essayist, Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Man is what he \\nthinks all day long.” \\n• What is impressed in the subconscious is expressed \\nWilliam James, the father of American psychology, said that t he \\npower to move the world is in your subconscious mind. Your \\nsubconscious mind is one with infinite intelligence and boundless \\nwisdom. It is fed by hidden springs, and is called the law of life. Whatever you impress upon your subconscious mind, the latter wil l \\nmove heaven and earth to bring it to pass. 42  You must, therefore, impress it with right ideas and construc-t ive \\nthoughts. The reason there is so much chaos and misery in the world is \\nbecause people do not understand the interaction of their consci ous \\nand subconscious minds. When these two principles work in accord, \\nin concord, in peace, and synchronously together, you will have heath, \\nhappiness, peace and joy. There is no sickness or discord when the  \\nconscious and subconscious work together harmoniously and \\npeacefully. The tomb of Hermes was opened with great expectancy and a se nse \\nof wonder because people believed that the greatest secret of the ages \\nwas contained therein. The secret was as within, so without; as above, \\nso below. In other words, whatever is impressed hi your subconscious mind is \\nexpressed on the screen of space. This same truth was pr oclaimed by \\nMoses, Isaiah, Jesus, Buddha, Zoroaster, Laotze, and all the illumine d \\nseers of the ages Whatever you feel as true subjectivel y is expressed \\nas conditions, experiences, and events. Motion and emotion must \\nbalance. As in  heaven [your own mind], so on earth [in your body and \\nenvironment]. This is the great law of life. You will find throughout all nature the law of action and reaction, of \\nrest and motion. These two must balance, then there will be h armony \\nand equilibrium. You are here to let the life principle flow t hrough \\nyou rhythmically and harmoniously. The intake and the outgo must be \\nequal. The impression and the expression must be equal. All your \\nfrustration is due to unful-filled desire. If you think negatively, destructively, and viciously, these tho ughts \\ngenerate destructive emotions which must be expressed and find a n \\noutlet. These emotions, being of a negative nature, are frequently expressed \\nas ulcers, heart trouble, tension, and anxieties. What is your idea or feeling about yourself now? Every part of your \\nbeing expresses that idea. Your vitality, body, fi-nancial sta tus,  \\n 43  friends, and social status represent a perfect re-flectio n of the idea you \\nhave of yourself. This is the real mean-ing of what is impressed in your sub conscious \\nmind, and which is expressed in all phases of your life. We injure ourselves by the negative ideas, which we enter- tain. How often have you wounded yourself by getting angry, fearful, \\njealous, or vengeful? These are the poisons that enter your \\nsubconscious mind. You were not born with these negative attitude s. Feed your subconscious mind life-giving thoughts, and you will wipe \\nout all the negative patterns lodged therein. As you continue to do this, \\nall the past will be wiped out and remembered no more. • The subconscious heals a malignancy of the skin \\nA personal healing will ever be the most convincing evi-dence of  \\nthe healing power of the subconscious mind. Over forty years ag o I \\nresolved a malignancy of the skin through prayer. Medical ther apy \\nhad failed to check the growth, and it was get-ting progressiv ely \\nworse. A clergyman, with a deep psychological knowledge, ex-plained to \\nme the inner meaning of the 139th Psalm wherein it says, In thy book \\nall my members were written, which in con-tinuance were fashi oned, \\nwhen as yet there was none of them. He explained that the term book \\nmeant my subconscious mind, which fashioned and molded all my \\norgans from an invisible cell. He also pointed out that inasmuch as my \\nsubconscious mind made my body, it could also recreate it and he al it \\naccording to the perfect pattern within it. This clergyman showed me his watch and said, “This had a maker , \\nand the watchmaker had to have the idea first in mind before the  \\nwatch became an objective reality, and if the watch was out  of order, \\nthe watchmaker could fix it.” My friend re-minded me that the \\nsubconscious intelligence, which created my body, was like a  \\nwatchmaker, and it also knew exactly how to heal, restore, and direct \\nall the vital functions and processes of my body, but that I ha d to give  \\n 44  it the perfect idea of health. This would act as cause, and the  effect \\nwould be a healing. I prayed in a very simple way as follows: “My body and al l its \\norgans were created by the infinite intelligence in my sub -conscious \\nmind. It knows how to heal me. Its wisdom fashioned all my organs, \\ntissues, muscles, and bones. This infinite healing presence wi thin me \\nis now transforming every atom of my being making me whole and \\nperfect now. I give thanks for the healing I know is taking pla ce now. Wonderful are the works of the creative intelligence within me.” \\nI prayed aloud for about five minutes two or three times a da y \\nrepeating the above simple prayer. In about three months my sk in was \\nwhole and perfect. As you can see, all I did was give life-giving patterns of wholeness, \\nbeauty, and perfection to my subconscious mind, thereby oblitera ting \\nthe negative images and patterns of thought lodged in my \\nsubconscious mind which were the cause of all my trouble. Nothing  \\nappears on your body except when the mental equivalent is first in \\nyour mind, and as you change your mind by drenching it with \\nincessant affirmatives, you change your body.

For \\nexample, while you are asleep your heart con-tinues to beat \\nrhythmically, your lungs do not rest, and the proc-ess of inhalation \\nand exhalation, whereby your blood absorbs fresh air, goes on just the  \\nsame as when you are awake. Your subconscious controls your \\ndigestive processes and glandular secretions, as well as a ll the other \\nmysterious operations of your body. The hair on your face continues \\nto grow whether you are asleep or awake. Scientists tell us that the  \\n 45  skin secretes much more perspiration during sleep than during t he \\nwaking hours. Your eyes, ears, and other senses are active during sleep. Fo r \\ninstance,   many of our great scientists have received answe rs to \\nperplexing problems while they were asleep. They saw the an-sw ers in \\na dream. Oftentimes your conscious mind interferes with the normal rhythm  \\nof the heart, lungs, and functioning of the stomach and intestines b y \\nworry, anxiety, fear, and depression. These pat-terns of thought \\ninterfere with the harmonious functioning of your subconscious mind. When mentally disturbed, the best procedure is to let go, rela x, and \\nstill the wheels of your thought processes. Speak to your subconscious mind, telling it to take over in pea ce, \\nharmony, and divine order. You will find that all the functions of your \\nbody will become normal again. Be sure to speak to your \\nsubconscious mind with authority and convic-tion, and it will confor m \\nto your command. Your subconscious seeks to preserve your life and restore you t o \\nhealth at all costs. It causes you to love your children, which a lso \\nillustrates an instinctive desire to preserve all life . Let us suppose you \\naccidentally ate some bad food. Your sub-conscious mind would \\ncause you to regurgitate it. If you in-advertently took some poison, your subconscious powers \\nwould proceed to neutralize it. If you completely entrusted your self to \\nits wonderworking  power, you would be entirely restored to health. • How to get the subconscious to work for you \\nThe first thing to realize is that your subconscious mind is al ways \\nworking. It is active night and day, whether you act upon it or not . Your subconscious is the builder of your body, but you cannot \\nconsciously perceive or hear that inner silent process.

Just keep \\nyour conscious mind busy with the expectation of the best, and make  \\n 46  sure the thoughts you habitually think are based on whatsoever thi ngs \\nare lovely, true, just, and of good report. Begin now to take c are of \\nyour con-scious mind, knowing in your heart and soul that your \\nsubcon-scious mind is always expressing, reproducing, and \\nmanifesting according to your habitual thinking.

Judge \\nThomas Troward says, “The vaguest nerve passes out of the cere bral \\nregion as a portion of the voluntary system, and through it we c ontrol \\nthe vocal organs; then it passes onward to the thorax sending out \\nbranches to the heart and lungs; finally, passing through the \\ndiaphragm, it loses the outer coating which distinguishes the ner ves of \\nthe voluntary system and becomes identified with those of the \\nsympathetic system, so forming a connecting link between the two  \\nand making the man physically a single entity. 89  “Similarly different areas of the brain indicate their con-nection \\nwith the objective and subjective activities of the mind respectively, \\nand speaking in a general way we may assign the frontal portion of the \\nbrain to the former and the posterior portion to the latter, wh ile the \\nintermediate portion partakes of the character of both.” \\nA rather simple way of looking at the mental and physical \\ninteraction is to realize that your conscious mind grasps an idea, which \\ninduces a corresponding vibration in your voluntary sys-tem of nerves. This in turn causes a similar current to be gen-erated i n your \\ninvoluntary system of nerves, thus handling the idea over to your \\nsubconscious mind, which is the creative me-dium. This is how your  \\nthoughts become things. Every thought entertained by your conscious mind and ac-cepted as \\ntrue is sent by your brain to your solar plexus, the brain of your  \\nsubconscious mind, to be made into your flesh, and to be brought forth \\ninto your world as a reality. • There is an intelligence which takes care of the body \\nWhen you study the cellular system and the structure of the organs,  \\nsuch as eyes, ears, heart, liver, bladder, etc., you learn they c onsist of \\ngroups of cells which form a group intelligence whereby they  function \\ntogether and are able to take orders and carry them out in deduct ive \\nfunction at the suggestion of the master mind (conscious mind). A careful study of the single-celled organism shows you what goes \\non in your complex body. Though the mono-cellular organism has no \\norgans, it still gives evidence of mind action and reaction per forming \\nthe basic functions of movement, ali-mentation, assimilation, and  \\nelimination. Many say there is an intelligence, which will take care of your body \\nif you let it alone. That is true, but the difficulty is that the conscious \\nmind always interferes with its five-sense evi-dence based on outer \\nappearances, leading to the sway of false beliefs, fears , and mere \\nopinion. When fear, false beliefs, and negative patterns ar e made to \\nregister in your subconscious mind through psychological, emotional   \\n 90  conditioning, there is no other course open to the subconscious mind \\nexcept to act on the blue-print specifications offered it. • The subconscious mind works continually for the common good \\nThe subjective self within you works continuously for the genera l \\ngood, reflecting an innate principle of harmony behind all things . Your subconscious mind has its own will, and it is a very real \\nsomething in itself. It acts night and day whether you act upon it or not. It is the b uilder \\nof your body, but you cannot see, hear, or feel it building, as all this is \\na silent process. Your subconscious has a life of its own whic h is \\nalways moving toward harmony, health, and peace. This is the divin e \\nnorm within it seeking expression through you at all times. • How man interferes with the innate principle of harmony \\nTo think correctly, scientifically, we must know the “Truth. ” To \\nknow the truth is to be in harmony with the infinite intelli-ge nce and \\npower  of your subconscious mind, which is always moving lifeward. Every thought or action, which is not harmonious, whether through \\nignorance or design, will result in discord and limitation of all kinds. Scientists inform us that you build a new body every eleven m onths; \\nso you are really only eleven months old from a physical standpoint. If \\nyou build defects back into your body by thoughts of fear, anger, \\njealousy, and ill will, you have no one to blame but yourself. You are the sum total of your own thoughts. You can keep from \\nentertaining negative thought and imagery. The way to get rid o f \\ndarkness is with light; the way to overcome cold is with heat ; the way \\nto overcome the negative thought is to substitute the good thought . Affirm the good, and the bad will vanish. • Why it ’s normal to be healthy, vital, and strong it ’s abnormal to \\nbe sick \\nThe average child born into the world is perfectly healthy with all \\nits organs functioning perfectly. This is the normal state, and w e  \\n 91  should remain healthy, vital, and strong. The instinct of self-\\npreservation is the strongest instinct of your nature, and it constitutes a  \\nmost potent, ever-present, and constantly opera-tive truth, inhe rent in \\nyour nature. It is, therefore, obvious that all your thoughts, i deas, and \\nbeliefs must operate with greater potentiality when they  are in \\nharmony with the innate life-principle in you, which is forever seeking \\nto preserve and protect you along all lines. It follows from thi s that \\nnormal conditions can be restored with greater ease and certai nty than \\nabnormal conditions can be induced. It is abnormal to be sick; it simply means you are going a gainst the \\nstream of life and thinking negatively. The law of life is the  law of \\ngrowth; all nature testifies to the operation of this law  by silently, \\nconstantly expressing itself in the law of growth. Where there  is \\ngrowth and expression, there must be life; where there is l ife there \\nmust be harmony, and where there is harmony, there is perfect health. If your thought is in harmony with the creative principle of y our \\nsubconscious mind, you are in tune with the innate prin-ciple of \\nharmony. If you entertain thoughts which are not in accordance with \\nthe principle of harmony, these thoughts cling to you, harass you, \\nworry you, and finally bring about disease, and if persisted in, \\npossibly death. In the healing of disease, you must increase the inflow and \\ndistribution of the vital forces of your subconscious mind throug hout \\nyour system. This can be done by eliminating thoughts of fear, worry , \\nanxiety, jealousy, hatred, and every other destructive thought w hich \\ntends to tear down and destroy your nerves and glands—body tissue \\nwhich controls the elimina-tion of all waste material. • Pott’s disease cured \\nIn the Nautilus magazine of March, 1917, there appears an article \\nabout a boy suffering from Pott’s disease, or tuber-culosis of the \\nspine, who had a remarkable healing.

They believed that this strange power could be invoked under \\ncertain conditions, and that the alleviation of human suffering would \\nfollow. The history of all nations presents testimony in support of this \\nbelief. In the early history of the world the power of secretly in-f luencing \\nmen for good or evil, including the healing of the sick, was said to be \\npossessed by the priests and holy men of all nations. Healing of the \\nsick was supposed to be a power derived directly by them f rom God,  \\nand the procedures and processes of healing varied throughout th e \\nworld. The healing processes took the form of supplications to  God \\nattended by various cere-monies, such as the laying on of hands, \\nincantations, the applica-tion of amulets, talismans, rings, r elics, and \\nimages. For example, in the religions of antiquity priests in the anci ent \\ntemples gave drugs to the patient and practiced hypnotic sugg estions \\nprior to the patient’s sleep, telling him that the gods would vis it him in \\nhis sleep and heal him. Many healings fol-lowed. Obviously, all th is \\nwas the work of potent suggestions to the subconscious mind. After the performance of certain mysterious rites, the de-vot ees of \\nHecate would see the goddess during sleep, provided that before going \\nto sleep they had prayed to her according to weird and fantas tic \\ninstructions. They were told to mix lizards with resin, frankincense, and myrrh, \\nand pound all this together in the open air under the crescent m oon. Healings were reported in many cases following this grotesque  \\nprocedure. 51  It is obvious that these strange procedures, as mentioned in the \\nillustrations given, favored suggestion and acceptance by the \\nsubconscious mind of these people by making a powerful app eal to \\ntheir imagination. Actually, in all these healings, the sub-conscious mind of the subject \\nwas the healer. In all ages unofficial healers have obtained remarkable re-sults in \\ncases where authorized medical skill has failed. This gives  cause for \\nthought. How do these healers in all parts of the world effect t heir \\ncures? The answer to all these healings is due to the blind beli ef of the \\nsick person, which released the healing power resident in his \\nsubconscious mind. Many of the remedies andmethods employed  \\nwere rather strange and fantastic which fired the imagination of the \\npatients, causing an aroused emo-tional state. This state of mind \\nfacilitated the suggestion of health, and was accepted both by t he \\nconscious and subconscious mind of the sick. This will be elabor ated \\non further in the next chapter. • Biblical accounts on the use of the subconscious powers \\nWhat things soever ye desire, when ye pray believe that ye re ceive \\nthem, and ye shall have them. MARK 11:24. Note the difference in tenses. The inspired writer tells us to believe \\nand accept as true the fact that our desire has already b een \\naccomplished and fulfilled, that it is already completed, and t hat its \\nrealization will follow as a thing in the future. The success of this technique depends on the confident conviction \\nthat the thought, the idea, the picture is already a fact in mind. In or der \\nfor anything to have substance in the realm of mind, it must be \\nthought of as actually existing there. Here in a few cryptic words is a concise and specific di rec-tion for \\nmaking use of the creative power of thought by im-pressing up on the \\nsubconscious the particular thing, which you desire. Your thought,  \\nidea, plan, or purpose is as real on its own plane as your ha nd or your  \\n 52  heart. In following the Biblical tech-nique, you completely elim inate \\nfrom your mind all considera-tion of conditions, circumstances, or \\nanything, which might im-ply adverse contingencies. You are planting  \\na seed (concept) in the mind, which, if you leave it undisturbed, w ill \\ninfallibly germinate into external fruition. The prime condition, which Jesus insisted upon, was faith. Over an d \\nover again you read in the Bible, According to your faith is it done \\nunto you. If you plant certain types of seeds in the ground, you have faith t hey \\nwill grow after their kind. This is the way of seeds, and trus ting the \\nlaws of growth and agricul-ture, you know that the seeds will come  \\nforth after their kind. Faith as mentioned in the Bible is a wa y of \\nthinking, an attitude of mind, an inner certitude, knowing that the ide a \\nyou fully accept in your conscious mind will be embodied in your sub-\\nconscious mind and made manifest. Faith is, in a sense, accept- ing as \\ntrue what your reason and senses deny, i.e., a shutting out of the litt le, \\nrational, analytical, conscious mind and embracing an attitude of  \\ncomplete reliance on the inner power of your subconscious mind. A classical instance of Bible technique is recorded in MA TTHEW \\n9:28-30. And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to \\nhim: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, sayi ng, \\naccording to your faith be it unto you. And their eyes were opened ; \\nand Jesus straitly charged them, saying, see that no man know it. In the words according to your faith be it unto you , you can see that \\nJesus was actually appealing to the co-operation of the sub conscious  \\nmind of the blind men. Their faith was their great expectancy, t heir \\ninner feeling, their inner conviction that something miraculous w ould \\nhappen, and that their prayer would be answered, and it was. T his is \\nthe time-honored technique of healing, utilized alike by all heal ing \\ngroups throughout the world regardless of religious affiliation. In the words see that no man know it, Jesus enjoins the newly \\nhealed  \\n 53  patients not to discuss their healing because they might be subjected \\nto the skeptical and derogatory criticisms of the unbeliev ing. This \\nmight tend to undo the benefits they had received at the hand of Jes us \\nby depositing thoughts of fear, doubt, and anxiety in the subconsci ous \\nmind ... for with authority and power he commandeth the un-clean \\nspirits , and they came out. LUKE 4:36. When the sick came to Jesus to be healed, they were healed by t heir \\nfaith together with his faith and understanding of the healing pow er of \\nthe subconscious mind. Whatever he decreed, he felt inwardly to b e \\ntrue. He and the people needing help were in the one universal  \\nsubjective mind, and his silent inner know-ing and conviction of the \\nhealing power changed the negative destructive patterns in the  \\npatients’ subconscious. The resultant healings were the au tomatic  \\nresponse to the internal mental change. His command was his app eal \\nto the subconscious mind of the patients plus his awareness,  feeling, \\nand absolute trust in the response of the subconscious mind to t he \\nwords which he spoke with authority. • Miracles at various shrines throughout the world \\nIt is an established fact that cures have taken place at various shri nes \\nthroughout the world, such as in Japan, India, Europe, and America. I \\nhave visited several of the famous shrines in Japan. At the  world \\nfamous shrine called Diabutsu is a gigantic divinity of bronze where \\nBuddha is seated with folded hands, and the head is inclined in an \\nattitude of profound contemplative ecstasy. It is 42 feet in height and \\nis called the great Buddha. Here I saw young and old making offerings at its feet. Money, f ruit,  \\nrice, and oranges were offered. Candles were lit, incense was  burned, \\nand prayers of petition recited. The guide explained the chant of a young girl as she mur-mured a \\nprayer, bowed low, and placed two oranges as an offer-ing. She als o \\nlit a candle. He said she had lost her voice, and it was res tored at the \\nshrine. She was thanking Buddha for restor-ing her voice. She had t he \\nsimple faith that Buddha would give her back her singing voice if  she  \\n 54  followed a certain ritual, fasted, and made certain offerings. Al l this \\nhelped to kindle faith and expectancy, resulting in a conditioning of \\nher mind to the point of belief. Her subconscious mind responded t o \\nher belief.

Your subconscious processes are always lifeward and con-st ructive. Your subconscious is the builder of your body and maintains all its  \\nvital functions. It is on the job 24 hours a day and never sleeps . It is \\nalways trying to help and preserve you from harm. Your subconscious mind is in touch with infinite life and boundless \\nwisdom, and its impulses and ideas are always life-ward. The gr eat \\naspirations, inspirations, and visions for a grander and nobler life, \\nspring from the subconscious. Your profoundest convictions are those  \\nyou cannot argue about rationally because they do not come from your \\nconscious mind; they come from your subconscious mind. Your \\nsubconscious speaks to you in intuitions, impulses, hunches, \\nintimations, urges, and ideas, and it is always telling you to ris e, \\ntranscend, grow, advance, adventure, and move forward to greater \\nheights. The urge to love, to save the lives of others comes from the \\ndepths of your subconscious. For example, during the great San \\nFrancisco earthquake and fire of April 18, 1906, invalids and cripples \\nwho had been confined to bed for long periods of time, rose up and \\nperformed some of the most amazing feats of bravery and enduranc e. The intense desire welled up within them to save others at all  costs, \\nand their subconscious responded accordingly. Great artists, musicians, poets, speakers, and writers tune in with \\ntheir subconscious powers and become animated and inspired. For \\nexample, Robert Louis Stevenson, before he went to sleep, us ed to \\ncharge his subconscious with the task of evolv-ing stories for  him \\nwhile he slept. He was accustomed to ask his subconscious to g ive  \\n 88  him a good, marketable thriller when his bank account was low. Stevenson said the intelligence of his deeper mind gave him the  story \\npiece by piece, like a serial. This shows how your subconsci ous will \\nspeak lofty and wise sayings through you, which your conscious mind \\nknows nothing about. Mark Twain confided to the world on many occasions that he never \\nworked in his life. All his humor and all his great writ-ings were due \\nto the fact that he tapped the inexhaustible reser-voir of h is \\nsubconscious mind. • How the body portrays the workings of the mind \\nThe interaction of your conscious and subconscious mind requires a \\nsimilar interaction between the corresponding system of nerve s. The \\ncerebrospinal system is the organ of the conscious mind, and th e \\nsympathetic systemis the organ of the subcon-scious mind. The \\ncerebrospinal system is the channel through which you receive  \\nconscious perception by means of your five physical senses and \\nexercise control over the movement of your body. This system ha s its \\nnerves in the brain, and it is the chan-nel of your volitional and \\nconscious mental action. The sympathetic system, sometimes referred to as the in-v oluntary \\nnervous system, has its center in a ganglionic mass at the ba ck of the \\nstomach known as the solar plexus, and is some-times spoken of as  \\nthe abdominal brain. It is the channel of that mental action whic h \\nunconsciously supports the vital func-tions of the body.', 'similarity_score': 0.613759972419386}, {'chunk_text': 'Your subconscious has the answer to all problems.

Every thought is a cause, and every condition is an effect. 6. If you want to write a book, write a wonderful play, give a better \\ntalk to your audience, convey the idea lovingly and feelingly to y our \\nsubconscious mind, and it will respond accordingly. 7. You are like a captain navigating a ship. He must give the  right \\norders, and likewise, you must give the right orders (thoughts a nd \\nimages) to your subconscious mind, which controls and governs all \\nyour experiences. 8. Never use the terms, “I can’t afford it” or “I can’t do th is.” Your \\nsubconscious mind takes you at your word and sees to it that you do \\nnot have the money or the ability to do what you want to do. Affir m, \\n“I can do all things through the power of my subconscious mind.” \\n9. The law of life is the law of belief. A belief is a thought  in your \\nmind. Do not believe in things to harm or hurt you. Believe in th e \\npower of your subconscious to heal, inspire, strengthen, and prosp er \\nyou. According to your belief is it done unto you. 10. Change your thoughts, and you change your destiny. 24  2 \\nHow Your Own Mind Works \\nYou have a mind, and you should learn how to use it. There are two \\nlevels of your mind—the conscious or rational level, and the \\nsubconscious or irrational level. You think with your conscious mind, \\nand whatever you habitually think sinks down into your subconscious \\nmind, which creates according to the nature of your thoughts. Your \\nsubconscious mind is the seat of your emotions and is the cre ative \\nmind. If you think good, good will follow; if you think evil, evil will  \\nfollow. This is the way your mind works. The main point to remember is once the subconscious mind acce pts \\nan idea, it begins to execute it. It is an interesting and subtle truth that \\nthe law of the subconscious mind works for good and bad ideas alik e. This law, when applied in a negative way, is the cause of failure, \\nfrustration, and unhappiness. How-ever, when your habitual thinking \\nis harmonious and construc-tive, you experience perfect health, \\nsuccess, and prosperity. Peace of mind and a healthy body are inevitable when you begin to \\nthink and feel in the right way. Whatever you claim mentally a nd feel \\nas true, your subconsciousmind will accept and bring forth into you r \\nexperience. The only thing necessary for you to do is to get y our \\nsubconscious mind to accept your idea, and the law of your own \\nsubconscious mind will bring forth the health, peace, or the po sition \\nyou desire. You give the command or decree, and your subconscious \\nwill faithfully repro-duce the idea impressed upon it. The la w of your \\nmind is this: You will get a reaction or response from your \\nsubconscious mind according to the nature of the thought or idea you \\nhold in your conscious mind. Psychologists and psychiatrists point out that when thoughts are \\nconveyed to your subconscious mind, impressions are made in the \\nbrain cells. As soon as your subconscious accepts any idea, it proceeds \\nto put it into effect immediately. It works by asso-ciat ion of ideas and  \\n 25  uses every bit of knowledge that you have gathered in your life time to \\nbring about its purpose. It draws on the infinite power, energ y, and \\nwisdom within you. It lines up all the laws of nature to get its way. Sometimes it seems to bring about an immediate solution to your \\ndifficulties, but at other times it may take days, weeks, or l onger. ...', 'similarity_score': 0.6137202778221825}, {'chunk_text': '3.

These functions include the beating of your heart, the breathing of your lungs, the process of inhalation and exhalation, the digestive processes, glandular secretions, and the growth of hair, among other mysterious operations of the body. The subconscious mind continues to control these functions during sleep, and in some cases, it can even help in solving perplexing problems, as seen in the experiences of many great scientists. The conscious mind can sometimes interfere with the normal rhythm of these functions through worry, anxiety, fear, and depression. However, by speaking to the subconscious mind and commanding it to take over in peace, harmony, and divine order, one can restore the normal functioning of the body.

These functions include the beating of your heart, the breathing of your lungs, the process of inhalation and exhalation, the digestive processes, glandular secretions, and the growth of hair, among others. The subconscious mind continues to control these functions even when you are asleep, and scientists have found that the skin secretes more perspiration during sleep than during waking hours. The senses, such as the eyes and ears, are also active during sleep. The subconscious mind can be interfered with by patterns of thought such as worry, anxiety, fear, and depression, but when mentally disturbed, it is best to let go, relax, and still the wheels of your thought processes. Speaking to your subconscious mind and telling it to take over in peace, harmony, and divine order can help restore the normal functioning of your body.
